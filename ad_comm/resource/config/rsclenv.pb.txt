# In case for multiple soc/pc, you may want to apply different
# setting to differet soc.
# So you can use the `condition` to do a conditional loading
# The env within the group will only be loaded if and only if
# the current soc match the rule in `condition`

# For example. You have 2 soc in a platform, and you want them to communicate using cyber

# For soc A
group {
    condition: {
       and: {
          mac_address: ""
       }
    }
    env {
        key: "CYBER_IP"
        value: "10.151.179.70"
    }
}

# For soc B
group {
    condition: {
       and: {
          mac_address: "32:a3:10:32:90:71"
       }
    }
    env {
        key: "CYBER_IP"
        value: "10.151.179.71"
    }
}

group {
    env {
        key: "CYBER_DOMAIN_ID"
        value: "55"
    }
}
