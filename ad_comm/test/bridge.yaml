# dynamic library path: defines the path to the dynamic library.
# like: /home/xxx/xxx.so or ../include/xxx.so
dynamic-library-paths:
  - ./libad_msg_bridge_include.so
  - ./libad_msg_bridge_include1.so

# bridges: defines the bridges to be loaded.
# topic-name: defines the topic name, used to create subscriber and publisher.
#   It should be unique in the bridges,
#   because it will be used as the key to find message-type.
# NOTE: topic-name must be lower case;
#       because ROS only valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, / and _.
# message-type: defines the message type,
#   it should be the same as the message type defined in the dynamic library.
